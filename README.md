# HexPM
HexPM is a package manager for Windows 10.

## Summary
HexPM is a package manager coded in C# for Windows 10. It can install packages, uninstall them, check their versions, update them, etc.

## Limitations
As of now, the amount of packages HexPM is capable of installing is small, and aside from that some packages don't even work. We also know that it can be a bit slow at times and that some commands simply break down unexpectedly.

## Requirements

- A system running Windows 10 64-bit
- An internet connection
- Working Path variables
- Working command prompt

## Future Goals

- Add more packages

## License
The Unlicense - For the moment I've chosen The Unlicense because I don't want to impose restrictions or limit compatibility during the beta stages of development. In all honesty, it's more to avoid any legal trouble in using other people's software since they use other licenses. Overall, The Unlicense is good for this software because it allows anyone to make improvements or use this as a template, as well as allowing me as a developer to use other forms of software without the worry of including licenses and such.

## Credits
xsucculentx has contributed enough to the project to be considered a developer. He has rewritten parts of the code and given plenty of advice on how syntax and visuals should work within HexPM.

I got some help from members of the C# Discord server.
