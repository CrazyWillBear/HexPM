# HexPM
HexPM is a package manager for Windows 10.

## Summary
HexPM is a package manager coded in C# for Windows 10. It can install packages, uninstall them, check their versions, update them, etc.

## Limitations
As of now, the amount of packages HexPM is capable of installing is small, and aside from that some packages don't even work. We also know that it can be a bit slow at times and that some commands simply break down unexpectedly.

## Future Goals
- Update individual packages command (`u <packagename>`)
- Possibly a command to update HexPM from the package manager itself (emphasis on the "possibly")
- Possibly improve how HexPM looks (maybe add color, maybe change the way that text appears, etc)
